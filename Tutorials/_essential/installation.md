## Installation

This document explains how to install an operating system and some other important software on your Beaglebone Black.

The aim is to install the following essentials for hybrid audio + physical computing projects:

* debian (operating system)
* jack (for audio)
* supercollider (programming language for audio synthesis)
* python (programming language for managing the GPIOs on the beagle board)
* adafruit BBIO library (python library for interfacing with the beaglebone pin-ins/outs)
* pyOSC (python library for communicating via the Open Sound Control protocol)

Debian will be installed on the SD card from a PC, whilst the other software will be installed from the command line by booting the SD card in the beaglebone and logging in to it remotely via SSH. As each stage is relatively complex and time-consuming, you may wish to backup your SD card along the way...for more on this see [the backup tutorial](https://github.com/sidechained/TrainingTheBeagle/blob/master/Tutorials/_essential/backup.md).

### Requirements

You will need:

* a laptop capable of running a unix terminal (i.e. mac/linux)
* a beaglebone black
* a 4GB SD card (minimum)
* a micro to normal size SD card convertor (to insert the SD card into your computer)
* a simple USB sound card for your beaglebone (for audio testing)
* an ethernet connection to your Beaglebone Black (ethernet cable, switch or wireless router) 
* a working internet connection on the Beaglebone Black (see separate tutorial on internet access [here](http://www.TODO.com))

#### SSH Basics

compare with: https://github.com/redFrik/udk10-Embedded_Systems/tree/master/udk131114#--logging-in

* connect your beaglebone via ethernet
* ping the beagle board to see if it exists  
`$ ping 192.168.2.14`
* you should see:
```
PING 192.168.2.14 (192.168.2.14): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.2.14: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.702 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.14: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.543 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.2.14: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.543 ms
```
* now, attempt to login  
`$ ssh debian@192.168.2.14`
* enter password (default password = debian)
* if successful, the debian login message should appear as follows:
```
Linux debian-armhf 3.8.13-bone30 #1 SMP Thu Nov 14 02:59:07 UTC 2013 armv7l

#### Installing Physical Computing Software

_compare with_ https://github.com/redFrik/udk10-Embedded_Systems/tree/master/udk131114#--installing-software (python, bbio)

* The [Adafruit BBIO Library](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python) is one of a number of libraries written to interface with the beaglebone pin headers (for others see the [links section](https://github.com/sidechained/TrainingTheBeagle/blob/master/Tutorials/_essential/installation.md#links)

##### Installing the Adafruit BBIO Library

* This tutorial is (heavily) modified from the Angstrom or Ubuntu version found at:
https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-io-python-library-on-beaglebone-black/overview

* ssh into the beaglebone black
`$ ssh debian@192.168.2.14`
* make sure the beagle has the correct date and time
`$ sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org`
* make sure your debian packages are up to date
`$ sudo apt-get update`
* install python-pip package and dependecies
`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip -y`
* cd to an appropriate folder to temporarily clone a git repo to e.g.
`$ cd /home/debian`
* clone the adafruit BBIO library to this location
`$ git clone git://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python.git`
`$ cd adafruit-beaglebone-io-python`
`$ sudo python setup.py install`
* remove the cloned git repo
`$ cd ..`
`$ sudo rm -rf adafruit-beaglebone-io-python`
* check if the installation worked
`$ python -c "import Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO as GPIO; print GPIO"`
* you should see this or similar
`<module 'Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Adafruit_BBIO/GPIO.so'>`

For more details and to troubleshoot any problems see:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Adafruit_BBIO
https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/issues/12

##### Real World Test (optional)

* Wire up a basic LED circuit, as [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/blinking-an-led-with-beaglebone-black), then ssh in to your beagle and start the python interpreter, as follows:
`$ sudo python`
* import bbio library
`>>> import Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO as GPIO`
* setup a pin as an output:
`>>> GPIO.setup("P8_10", GPIO.OUT)`
* turn LED On:
`>>> GPIO.output("P8_10", GPIO.HIGH)`
* turn LED Off:
`>>> GPIO.output("P8_10", GPIO.LOW)`
* exit python
`>>> exit()`

#### Installing the Python pyOSC Library

* _compare with https://github.com/redFrik/udk10-Embedded_Systems/tree/master/udk131114#--installing-software (python, bbio)_

* NOTE: it is presumed that you have the correct packages installed, and that the date and time of your beaglebone is up to date. If not see the [previous section](https://github.com/sidechained/TrainingTheBeagle/blob/master/Tutorials/_essential/installation.md#installing-the-adafruit-bbio-library)

* ssh into the beaglebone black
$ ssh debian@192.168.2.14
* download an archive from here: https://trac.v2.nl/attachment/wiki/pyOSC/pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz
* copy the tar.gz file onto the beagleboard using scp
$ scp /path debian@192.168.2.14 :/home/Debian
* ssh in and untar the file
$ ssh debian@192.168.2.14
$ cd /home/debian
$ tar -xf pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz
* install pyosc
$ cd pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294  
_NOTE TO SELF: check the above line_
$ sudo python setup.py install
* remove the source code and zip
$ cd ..
$ rm -r pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294 
$ rm pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz

2. install pyOSC
- download from here: https://trac.v2.nl/attachment/wiki/pyOSC/pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz
- copy the tar.gz file onto the beagleboard
$ scp /path debian@x.x.x.x :/home/Debian
- ssh in and untar the file
$ ssh debian@x.x.x.x
$ cd /home/debian
$ tar -xf pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz
- install pyosc
$ cd pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294 (CHECK)
$ sudo python setup.py install
- remove the source code and zip
$ cd ..
$ rm -r pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294 
$ rm pyOSC-0.3.5b-5294.tar.gz

#### Backing Up the SD Card

Now you're done, consider [backing up the SD card](https://github.com/sidechained/TrainingTheBeagle/blob/master/Tutorials/_essential/backup.md)

### Troubleshooting

This section covers some things that can wrong during the above install process and how to solve them:

#### "cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option '-std=c++11'" when building supercollider from source

* can occur when doing `$ sudo make install`
* newer kernels seem to include old version of g++, which cmake doesn’t like
* solution is:  
`$ sudo apt-get install g++-4.7`
`$ cmake -L -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DSSE=OFF -DSSE2=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNOVA_SIMD=OFF -DSC_QT=OFF -DSC_WII=OFF -DSC_ED=OFF -DSC_IDE=OFF -DSC_EL=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-4.7 -DSEQAN_C++11_STANDARD=ON ..`

NOTE: Debian has the package under the name gcc-4.8 (or for the c++ compiler, g++-4.8)
NOTE: Installing those packages will not mess up your OS, as long as you do not rename it to g++.

#### PWM Not Working in Adafruit Library

This is down to an issue in the kernel, ideally need to update to bone24 or higher
We fixed it by following instructions here to flash sd card wtih debian 7.1 + bone24 : http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardDebian
